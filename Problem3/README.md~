This problem focuses on palindromic substrings and finding how many palindromes are within each substring of a particular string.

1. This problem can be solved recursively by starting with a substring that is the full string given, then continually breaking the string down into a smaller and smaller substring until individual letters are being read.

For example, this string "abc" would focus on the full string, then "ab" and finally "a", it every single character already counting as one palindrome, it would return three palindromes: "a", "b", "c".
